Most of us know about KeyDown or KeyPress events in JavaScript, and we use event emitted to access e.key or e.code property which gives the name of Key pressed.

The solution to this problem is the e.keyCode property which gives a unique code of key present on the keyboard. Now to know these unique codes I made this project. I created three files (an HTML file, a CSS file, and JavaScript File). and Also published on Netlify.
